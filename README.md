Requirements:
- Use the proper file for the fact.
  - Facts go in text files in the langs folder.
  - English facts go in `langs/en.txt`.
  - Any ISO 639 language is supported.
  - If a file does not exist, feel free to create it!
- Please use spellcheck! If a spelling mistake is found, a correction will be requested.
  - Pull requests for grammer and spelling corrections are welcome.
- All facts must be accompanied by a source.
  - Avoid blogs and pictoral websites (links tend to break).
  - Other websites on the subject must echo the same or similar fact (contradicting facts will be considered).
- Try to keep facts interesting and safe for work.
  - A fact about the name of a bone in a dolphin's jaw is a lot less interesting than a fact about the number of teeth a dolphin have.
  - Keep facts concise.
  - If a fact involves sensitive matters, keep it scientific.
